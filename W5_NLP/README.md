 NLP Project: Text Analysis & Vectorization
A comprehensive Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline designed to transform unstructured text into actionable insights. This project emphasizes statistical rigor, ensuring that word importance is calculated accurately across large datasets.

 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to process and analyze a large corpus of text (e.g., hotel reviews, tweets, or articles ,CVs) using advanced vectorization techniques. By converting text into numerical features, we enable machine learning models to classify sentiments or retrieve relevant documents based on semantic similarity.

 The NLP Pipeline
The project follows a modular architecture:

Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop-word removal, and cleaning to ensure high-quality input.

Vectorization: Implementation of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to weigh terms based on their uniqueness.

Similarity Scoring: Using Cosine Similarity to measure the distance between text vectors.

Modeling: Training supervised models (e.g., Logistic Regression) to predict categories or sentiments.
